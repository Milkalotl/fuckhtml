## The first festival experience

You love music. You're constantly looking for the best ways to listen to your favorite tunes (including the best in automotive technology), and now you've finally decided to go to your first music festival. You're excited, but also a little nervous; going to your first festival can be daunting. There are people everywhere, multiple stages, and your feet probably hurt already.

## 1. Plan Ahead

There will be several stages where musicians will perform all day long and into the night. Make a plan so you can get at the stage where your favorite musician will be and not miss them. By being prepared, you can make the most of your time.

## 2. Pack for all weathers

I advise packing clothing for every weather since, depending on where your festival is taking place, the weather may be extremely humid. If you don't, you risk missing acts and being forced to wait in your tent while the sky clears. It may seem basic, but remember to bring sunscreen and a raincoat.

## 3. Do NOT forget to hydrate

Use the free water refill stations and bring your own bottle to avoid paying outrageous prices for bottled water at most music festivals. You'll want to keep your fluid levels up when your favorite musician takes the stage so you can rip up the dance floor with the moves you've been perfecting in your bedroom all summer. Bring a stylish hydropack or a flask that you can quickly refill.

## 4. Have a meeting spot for your group

It's entirely acceptable if you want to separate from your pals and attend a few shows on your own since, after all, you don't get to watch an artist play live every day. However, if you want to avoid spending an emotional half-hour trying to find your team, be sure to choose a rendezvous location before you split apart. No matter how many functional phones you might have among the six of you, you can effectively reunite by selecting a straightforward meeting time and location in advance.

## 5. Always carry cash

Although bringing cash to a music festival may seem paradoxical, I can guarantee you that it's a wise decision because many of the food vendors and other vendors might not be keen on accepting credit card payments. And you don't want to spend the night without food, do you? Store some cash in your treasured fanny pack rather than taking the chance of losing your credit card on the crowded dance floor. Distribute your money across your possessions, such as your pockets, the bottoms of your shoes, the cover of your phone, etc., so that even if you lose a tenner from one place, you still have a few more to fall back on.
